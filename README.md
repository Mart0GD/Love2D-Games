All the games I made using the Love2D Framework which utilizes the C-like programming language Lua. 🎮

The games are available in a zip format. You can clone the repository and unzip the files or just download them from GitHub! 🕹️

Have fun playing! 🎉

PS: You can also find these games and others too on my itch.io profile here - https://mart-0.itch.io/
